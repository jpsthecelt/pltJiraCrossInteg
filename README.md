This is an example of how you would programmatically grab something from JIRA and push to Plutora.  

Programmed in Python, and using requests, this takes commandline parameters of form 
    '-j username:password -p username:password' , used to log into the respective systems.

(right now, we only read from <a local docker-JIRA>, and reading from the associated Plutora)
